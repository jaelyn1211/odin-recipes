First odin project: recipe site
starting my first project in html, i have the very basics of html and some css down. Im looking forward to seeing how my skillset grows from this point on even from now to the point where I finish this project. I think it will be cool to get this experience and I will probably use the skills I gain from this first recipe site to make it my own and to do personal side projects. - first update :)
